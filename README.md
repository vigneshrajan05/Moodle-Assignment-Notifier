# Moodle-Assignment-Notifier
 
During the lockdown on account of Covid - 19, the trend of online classes begun. And my college faculties started posting assignments through an online platform called Moodle. This Platform does not inform the Students when new assignments are posted, this led to missing due dates on assignments. So, I came up with an idea of Creating a Python script that would check for assignments on a daily basis and notify me through Email and Desktop Push Notification.
This script uses Selenium's Chrome Web driver to automate the Login Process and Scrape the contents and and notify us if there are new assignments!
